# Nutrition UCSC Web Scraper

**web_scraper.py**
- File that defines the web scraper functionality and generates a .json file of all the nutrition information from all of the dining halls (as of 6/19/2025, the web scraper only gets the food name, calories, allergens, protein, carbs, and fat for each food item.)

**dh_headers.py**
- Denotes the necessary headers for the web scraper so it doesn't get blocked by the website and the URLs for each of the dining halls.
